      <h1>WHY IS <i>InfoScience</i> SO IMPORTANT?</h1>
      <p><i>InfoScience</i> is a data visualization company that helps people create charts, infographics, maps and reports. We show people how to communicate with data in a clear and engaging way. <br>People who create infographics do their work partly because they believe infographics are a great way to communicate information. Since the people in this field also need to communicate information about their work, it was inevitable that infographics about infographics would eventually be created.</p>
      <h2>WHAT IS AN INFOGRAPHIC?</h2>        
      <p>An infographic is a popular form of content marketing that can help you simplify a complicated subject or turn an otherwise boring subject into a captivating experience. Ideally, an infographic should be visually engaging and contain a subject matter and data that is appealing to your target audience …something that is truly ‘link worthy’ or ‘share worthy’.</p>     
      <p>Exactly what it sounds like: Information expressed graphically, via drawings, pictures, maps, diagrams, charts or similar elements--all held together with a coherent visual theme and typically published as an image file. These days they are produced in both static and animated video forms.</p>
      <h2>HOW SHOULD AN INFOGRAPHIC BE?</h2>
      <p>Infographics should be concise, creative and educational, conveying a burst of data in an eye-catching, succinct, portable package. In a world where every brand has the ability to publish blogs and webinars and photos and research as part of its marketing effort, your own content has to be top-shelf; it must stand out from the sea of sameness and not waste a minute of a would-be customer's precious time.</p>
