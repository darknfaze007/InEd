# InEd

Through this project, we would like to develop an Infographics Web Editor for common users. 


The most common definition of Infographic describes it simply as a visual representation of information and data. By combining elements of text image, chart, diagram and, more recently, video, an infographic is an effective tool to present data and explain complex issues in a way that can quickly lead to insight and better understanding.


Our users would be able to import data from local files, using APIs or from public sources, based on an URL. 

The created infographics can be exported as PNG images or SVG illustrations


HALLO!
